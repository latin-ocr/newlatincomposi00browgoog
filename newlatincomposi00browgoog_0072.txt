neverthelees this Gratius ¹brings the charge that ’citizen-
ship has never been granted him. Now⁸ the testimony of
Lucullus and of the delegatos ⁴from Heraclea as well as

enrolled and 'that he madehis declaration before the
praetorrk, Do not, therefore, jurem, reject thie man, who

’ me so much? Because they refresh my mind wearied
with daily atrise} because by them my ⁸power cf oratory
is increased3 and because they place before me the illus-
trious men whom the most famous authors have portrayed
in their werke. ‚p

(7) I admit· that these eminent men were not all

· highly edueated3 for natural ability is so! remarkable 'a

quality that many have become eminent in letters, artstl,
or arms· without formal education. But nevertheless
both natural ability and learning are needed¹¹ for the
meulding and development of'the loftiest characterss.

adivine spirit inspires. He is, therefore‚a gift of the
gods to us and worthy of our special¹³ love and honor. *ff

Let the people of Salamis claim¹⁴ Homer for their own;

’ (9) Archias is ours. His verses, which celebrate the

glory of the Roman people, we ¹'delight to heerssHe
honore not only Lucullus, who sunk the enemy's fleat off
Tenedos, but alito whom the Roman name and fame are
· dear.
