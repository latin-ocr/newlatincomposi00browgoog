PREFAOE

Anrnoucrr in the process of revision this book has
been practically rewritten, all the fundamental principles
which have characterized its predecessore and made them

· so successful have been retained. The authors' experience

as textboolr makers and toachers, the verdict of amul-
titude of teaehers who have used the former book, the
attitude of the universities and colleges ol highest rank,
the reports of the various Latin conferenoes‚ as well as
the recent flattering imitatione of the earlier books, afford
every convincing indorsement of the purpose and method
of this present work. At the same time new features
suggested by experience and developed by the applica·
tion of sound pedagogioal principles have been added.
These familiar with the last edition will here miss no
desirable feature of the former book and will find many
new onds.

Pnnw. -That the Latin Composition in the secondary
school should be based on the text read is a principle
now so generally accepted that its soundness and prac
’ tical wisdom may safely be assumed. To take immediate

, advantage ol* the pupil's live interest in the lesson just

, translated, to utllize the attention and concontration

already attamen-these solid and tangible gains far
outweigh the very largely theoretica] acquisitione which

are supposed to flow from mere grammatical and rhetori-
' iil
