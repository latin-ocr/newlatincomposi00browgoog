(1) Fellow citizens, the ¹espcoial favor oi the immortal
gods has snatohcd this fair land¹ oi ours from the great-
est· danger, and ³has made this a day which will always
be memorabis* in the republic.

Asl you do not know how great the perils are from
which this city has been saved, Ι must tell· you what
(2) Ι ⁸have been doing siuce' Catiline went away.

⁸diter spending days and nights in watching‚ I finally
learned· that certain Gauls 'were going to cross the Mul·
wian bridge last· night, and that Titus Volturcius would
be with¹⁰ them and would have letters for Catiline. ll
11When 1 had explained the matter ιο the prasinis, they
secretly led many'men ιο the bridge and (3) arrested
Volturcius and the Allobroges. 1'(iebinius, Statilius,
Cethegus, and Lentulus were straightway summoned to
me, and I then laid the whole matter before the senate.

(4) The Gauls and Volturcius testified that Oatiline '⁴
and the city leaders were about to burn· the city and
slaughter· the citizens, and that Cethegus wished· to do
this before the Saturnalia. .

(5) Then the tablets of each one were brought dorth
aud readhnlrhoughffi Lentulus acknowledged his seal,
he denied his guilt·; but finally, overwhelmedby the
power· of conscience, he was forcod¹⁴ ιο confess· all that
had been charged against him. His associates¹⁶ ¹⁸with
stcalthy glauces at each other lihewise confessed.
