There is no one so nntriendly to the musas that heis
not glad to hear his own aehievements praised hythe
poets. On being asked hy some one at Athens to whose
voiee he listened with the greatest pleasure, Themis·
tooles is said to have answered, “To his by whom my
own deeds are extolled in verse.'' hilsewise ¹the eele-
brated Marius hed great fondness for L. Plotius, think-
ing that through the latter³s geniem his ownvietories
would be celebrated. For the same reason the elder
Scipio beoame the friend of the poet Ennius. So, also,
Alexander the Great recognized how great is the velue
of the poet’s art when he oried out at the tomb of
Aehilles: “ Most fortunate of all men wast thou, 0
youth, in thet thou hedst Homer as the herald of thy
greatness.'’ Itis, however, not only these great men
themselves that are honored, but the glor-y of their
fatherlands is also⁴ handed down to posterity. Even
Greeee, if the Iliad had not existed, would have lost
her greatest renown.
