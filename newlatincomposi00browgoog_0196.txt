1. Dumnorix was a man of great daring, and was very
popular among the common people. He had long used
his influente to bring about a revolution. He had always
supported at his own expense a large number of cavalry .
aud kept them about him. The Romans knew that he
was devoted to the eausa of the Helvetians and that he
, detested the very name of Caesar, because by his arrival
his own influenoe had been lessened and that of his
brother was increased.

2. Cicero made provision· that the oity should have a
sufficiently strong guard. He had informed the munioi·
pal towns that Catiline intended to make an attaelr on
them by night, aud he warned them to be ready to defend
themselves( The Roman orator tells us in one of his
orations against Catilina that the conspirators regarded
the gladiatore astho most reliable part of their fomes,
but that in reality they were better dispos'ed towards the
state than many of the patriciana.
